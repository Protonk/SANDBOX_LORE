# Agents start here

When you work in this repo, treat the substrate, especially Orientation, Concepts, Appendix, Environment, and State as a fixed, opinionated model of the macOS Seatbelt sandbox and use them as your “world”. Answer questions and draft text in the project’s own vocabulary rather than generic OS-security jargon, and mentally route to the right document family when you reason. For example: Orientation for lifecycle/story, Concepts for exact definitions, Appendix for SBPL/binary details, Environment for containers and neighboring systems, State for time-bound behavior on macOS 13–14.
