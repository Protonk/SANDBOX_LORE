# Kernel symbols experiment — Plan

- Capture and iterate on kernel symbol/string outputs from Ghidra in a stable experiment location.
- Keep per-build outputs under `out/<build>/kernel-symbols/` for repeatable queries and follow-on scripts.
- Pivot from strings/symbols to targeted data-define and lookup runs to map sandbox-related artifacts.
