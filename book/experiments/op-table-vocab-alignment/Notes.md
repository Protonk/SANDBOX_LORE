10. **mach-lookup ID interpretation (2025-12-08)**
    - External evidence (sbtool-style operation_names[], Mazurek’s Sonoma sandbox validator, Apple entitlements) supports a single `mach-lookup` op ID (96) with namespace splits expressed via filters (`GLOBAL_NAME`, `LOCAL_NAME`, `XPC_SERVICE_NAME`), not multiple mach-lookup operation IDs.
    - The observed bucket mix {5,6} in op-table-operation should be treated as filter-driven structural differences in compiled graphs, not as evidence of multiple mach-lookup IDs. Alignment will continue to model mach-lookup as a single op with filters carrying the namespace semantics.
