# Op-table ↔ Operation Vocabulary Alignment – Notes

1. **Initialization (Chat agent, 2025-11-27)**
   - Created experiment directory `book/experiments/op-table-vocab-alignment/` alongside `node-layout` and `op-table-operation`.
   - Added initial `Plan.md` laying out setup, vocabulary hookup, alignment, interpretation, and turnover steps.
   - Created `ResearchReport.md` skeleton with motivation, scope, and planned structure; no code or analysis has been run yet.
   - Intent is to treat this experiment as a bridge between existing bucket-focused work and the vocabulary-mapping validation cluster, without assuming responsibility for full vocab extraction.
